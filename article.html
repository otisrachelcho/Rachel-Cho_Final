      <p>Giving people a small moment.
There are so many small moments hidden in our everyday.
But we don’t recognize them.
and even when we do recognize them,we tend to unconsciously reset our
minds and forget what we’ve seen.
But we believe these small moments are what make our days so
interesting, so rich.
That’s why we want to reconstitute the everyday by collecting and
reshaping them into something that’s easy to understand.
We’d like the people who’ve encountered designs to feel these
small moments intuitively.</p>

      <h2>New Material Award 2021</h2>
      <h5>Posted: October 24, 2021</h5>
      <img src="image/logo.jpg" alt="logo" width="100%;">
      <p>More and more designers are thinking about the effect of their designs in the circular chain from raw material to raw material. The role of the designer and design research are crucial in this. They contribute to a better and more sustainable society. The fifteen design and research projects nominated for the New Material Award 2018 are uncomfortable, confrontational, optimistic and visionary.
      </p>
	 <p>Material innovation encompasses much more than just the development of completely new materials. Generally, it revolves around a revaluation of raw materials, techniques, or residual products that are currently overlooked by industry as unsuitable for the intended purposes. This is done by exploring – without prejudice – new possibilities through research. From a loaded substance like animal blood, to bamboo that has been used for centuries; and from hair that we leave behind at the hairdresser, to waste glass that, according to established industries, would be impossible to reuse.</p>
	 <p>The New Material Award stimulates the development of sustainable materials through projects that provide smart solutions to the issues surrounding raw materials, energy and reuse – both in design and production.
     This 7thedition of the biennial New Material Award is organized by the DOEN Foundation, the Kwadraat Fund and Het Nieuwe Instituut. </p>

      <h2>New product: Color Clock</h2>
      <h5>Posted: June 4, 2021</h5>
      <img src="image/moc.jpeg" alt="clock" width="100%;">
      <p>A single edition of the “Pontos” series, a collection that represents the Swiss luxury watch brand “Maurice Lacroix”, which was redesigned for a special feature in the Global lifestyle magazine “Wallpaper”.
      The watch normally worn on the wrist can be inserted into a specially created stand, that looks like a wall clock, and enjoyed as an interior accessory.
      A typical cuckoo clock-like appearance enabled the wrist watch to visually blend into the wall clock, and to enhance this integrated expression, the digits were placed to extend outside the dial. 
      The incompleteness of the face characterized the design of this watch, and offered a feeling that it was a “piece that was cut out from a wall clock”.
      The body was finished with matte white to blend in with the interior, and pink gold was used as an accent for parts such as the letters and hands. 
	  The brand image of “Maurice Lacroix” was casually reflected by adopting details such as stretching the crown of wrist watch for the pendulum parts, and using their logo “m” for the eyes of the bird. </p>
